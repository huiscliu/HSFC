# HSFC
Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Partitioning for Parallel Computing

# Credit
The initial code was from PHG project, an open source project.

# Purpose
The algorithm partitions a distributed mesh/grid into a balanced distribution such that the new load imbalance factor less than
a given tolerance, such as 1.01. The partitioning is essential to parallel computing.
